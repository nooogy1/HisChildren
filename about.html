      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        His Children was born from a simple belief: that the best toys are the ones that bring families together, spark imagination, and stand the test of time—just like the toys we remember from our own childhoods.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why His Children -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Why "His Children"?</h2>
        <p>
          The name "His Children" reflects our foundational belief that every child is a precious gift. We believe children deserve to experience the wonder of play the way it was meant to be—simple, wholesome, and rooted in creativity rather than consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world that moves too fast, where screens compete for attention and plastic toys break before the week is out, we wanted to offer something different. Something that grandparents would recognize. Something that parents could feel good about. Something that children would actually treasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every toy in our collection is selected with intention, designed to nurture imagination, teach patience, and create the kind of memories that last a lifetime. Because at the end of the day, it's not about having more things—it's about having the right things.
        </p>

    <!-- Made in America -->
    <section class="about-section bg-surface">
      <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Proudly Made in America</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in supporting American workers, American families, and American values. That's why the majority of our products are designed and crafted right here in the United States, by skilled artisans who take pride in their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our wooden toys are made from sustainably harvested American hardwoods—maple, oak, beech, and basswood from responsibly managed forests. Our soft toys use organic cotton grown on American farms. When you purchase from His Children, you're supporting real people in real communities across this great nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know exactly where our materials come from and who makes our products. There are no overseas factories, no questionable labor practices, no corners cut. Just honest craftsmanship the way it used to be done.

    <!-- Values Quote -->
    <section class="about-quote">
      <blockquote>
        "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."

      <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Play the Way You Remember</h2>
        <p>
          Do you remember the toys of your childhood? The wooden blocks that you stacked into towers. The simple dolls that became characters in elaborate stories. The train sets that circled the Christmas tree. The puzzles that taught patience and the satisfaction of completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those toys didn't need batteries. They didn't make noise or flash lights. They didn't come with apps or internet connections. And yet, they created some of the happiest memories of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          At His Children, we believe today's children deserve that same experience. We believe there's something sacred about a child sitting on the floor with grandma or grandpa, building something together with their hands. Something that no tablet or video game can replace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our toys are designed to bring generations together. To give grandparents something meaningful to share with their grandchildren. To create the kind of quiet, focused play that develops creativity, patience, and character.

        <h2>Built to Be Passed Down</h2>
        <p>
          There's something special about a toy that's been loved by multiple generations. The wooden train set that Dad played with, then his children, and now his grandchildren. The stuffed bear that's been a faithful companion through three childhoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          We design every product with this in mind. Our toys aren't disposable—they're investments in memory-making. The natural materials age beautifully. The simple designs never go out of style. The quality construction stands up to years of play.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you give a gift from His Children, you're not just giving a toy. You're giving something that might just find its way to the next generation, carrying with it all the love and laughter of the children who came before.
